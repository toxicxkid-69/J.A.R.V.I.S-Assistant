## 📌 Requirements & Setup
See the complete step-by-step setup guide in **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)**.


## 📌Installation

1. **Fork The Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone The Repository**
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <URL>
     cd Jarvis-Desktop-Voice-Assistant
     ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
     - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - This activates the virtual environment and should look like `(venv) directory/of/your/project>`

4. **Install Requirements**

   - Install all the requirements given in **[requirements.txt]  by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. **Install PyAudio**  
   - Follow the instructions given **[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52283840/i-cant-install-pyaudio-on-windows-how-to-solve-error-microsoft-visual-c-14)**

6. **Run the Assistant**
  - Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python jarvis.py
    ```
  - Now Enjoy with your own assistant !!!!

7. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**
   - After you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

## 📌Learning Resources to Extend This Project

To build this project further and enhance its capabilities, a strong understanding of the following areas is recommended:

### 🐍 Python Fundamentals
Python is the core language behind this project. A solid grasp of syntax, control flow, functions, and error handling will help you modify and extend the assistant’s functionality.  
👉 [Python Programming Course](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/premium/master-python-programming)

### 🎙️ Voice Processing & NLP
Voice commands are processed using speech and text-based techniques. Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts such as tokenization and text analysis can help improve voice interaction.  
👉 [Introduction to NLP](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/learn-for-free/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing)

### 🤖 Intelligence & Generative AI
Currently, the assistant follows predefined logic. By integrating Generative AI concepts, it can be enhanced into a conversational assistant capable of generating intelligent responses and performing web-based tasks.  
👉 [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/premium/master-generative-ai)

### 👁️ Computer Vision
To make the assistant more advanced, computer vision can be introduced for features like face detection and gesture control. Learning image and video processing fundamentals is a good starting point.
